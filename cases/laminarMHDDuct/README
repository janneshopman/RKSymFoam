Benchmark cases for MHD laminar duct flow

Physics:
U flows in x direction
B field in y direction
    y-normal walls -> Hartmann walls
    z-normal walls -> side walls

Boundary conditions:
Periodic in x
Walls in y and z
U: no slip
p: zero gradient
electric potential:
    fully conductive -> uniform zero
    fully insulated  -> zero gradient
    (1) Hunt's case: Conductive Hartmann walls (y-normal), insulated side walls (z-normal)
    (2) Shercliff's case: All walls insulated
The case can be run either by imposing a mass flow, or by setting a pressure gradient

Non-dimensional quantities:
Reynolds 1000 = (Ly/2)*U0/nu
Hartmann 10   = (Ly/2)*By*sqrt(sigma/(rho*nu))

Physical values used in example:
Forcing U = 1 
Lx = 1
Ly = Lz = 2
nu = 0.001
sigma = 0.001
rho = 1
By = 10
tEnd = 100 
Forcing U can be replaced by a driving pressure gradient instead. 
This pressure is calculated by anaSol/ductAna.py and explained below.
To run the case with a pressure gradient, adjust constant/fvOptionsGradp and copy it to constant/fvOptions

Discretisation used in example:
Nx = 1
Ny = Nz = 40
dx = 1
dyWall = dzWall = 0.0199006213
dyBulk = dzBulk = 0.09950310655
Ratio Bulk/Wall = 5
Cell growth ratio in y and z: 1.08839840090822 (1.088^19 = ~5, 19 cell growths between wall and bulk, to get to the 5 ratio)
dt = 0.1
Temporal discretisations and Poisson solver parameters can all be found in system/{controlDict,fvSolutions}

Analytical solution:
An analytical solution exists for the Hunt and Shercliff cases, calculated by an iterative series.
This equation is given in Eq. 26 of J.C.R. Hunt 1964 - MHD flow in rectangular ducts
The equation is implemented in anaSol/analyticalSolutions.py
It calculates the velocity profile and analytical pressure gradient, given:
Ha (Hartmann number)
dB (Hartmann wall conductivity, 0 for Shercliff's case, inf for Hunt's case (large number gives same result, e.g. 10E12))
U0 (average velocity)
a (Lz/2)
b (Ly/2)
y (discrete points along y)
z (discrete points along z)
nu (viscosity)
rho (density)
kMax (number of iterations)
N.B. The solution is independent of Reynolds number

Velocity profiles in z along y=0 (side wall profile) and in y along z=0 (Hartmann wall profile) are generated with anaSol/ductAna.py
Set the required variables to calculate the profile and run (1000 iterations is more than enough)
In the example a 1001x1001 uniform resolution is used in y and z
The profiles are stored in U_y0.txt and U_z0.txt, and plotted in anaProfiles.pdf
The profiles for the Hunt and Shercliff case at Ha=10 are stored in plotSolutions/reference

Run and post-process the case with:
./run.sh <case>
where <case> is 'Hunt' or 'Shercliff'.
A plot is generated with reference results in plotSolutions/results/UProfiles.pdf
Example result plots for the Hunt and Shercliff case at Ha=10 are available in plotSolutions/results
