# RKSymFoam

This code contains slightly adjusted versions of the solvers used in the
paper "A symmetry-preserving second-order time-accurate PISO-based
method." by E.M.J. Komen, J.A. Hopman, E.M.A. Frederix, F.X. Trias and
R.W.C.P.  Verstappen. One notable adjustment is made in the pressure
gradient interpolation to follow the paper "An energy-preserving 
unconditionally stable fractional step method on collocated grids." by D.
Santos Serrano, F.X. Trias Miquel, G. Colomer Rey and C.D. PÃ©rez Segarra.
For a description of the method, please refer to these papers.

## Authors

The main structure of the solver, including the Runge-Kutta schemes was
developped by Edo Frederix, of the Nuclear Research and Consultancy Group 
(NRG), Westerduinweg 3, 1755 LE Petten, The Netherlands. The symmetry-
preserving method was applied to this structure by Jannes Hopman, of the 
Heat and Mass Transfer Technological Center, Technical University of 
Catalonia, C/Colom 11, 08222 Terrassa, Spain.

## Prerequisites

* OpenFOAM v2012. While it may compile against other versions, this is not
tested and currently not supported.
* Python with numpy and matplotlib

## Usage

* Make sure that OpenFOAM v2012 is loaded into your environment 
* Compile all libraries and apps with

<pre> ./Allwmake </pre>

## Test cases

* All test cases can be found in the cases directory, including a
Taylor-Green Vortex and a channel flow

### Taylor-Green Vortex

* Demonstrating the loss of kinetic energy due to numerical dissipation
over time
* Comparison between icoFoam and RKSymFoam using Backward Euler scheme 
* Run cases from the TGV directory using

<pre> ./launchCases.sh </pre>

### Channel flow

* Demonstrating accuracy of the solver to simulate turbulence
* Demonstrating the ability to include LES models 
* DNS cases: icoFoam (Backward Euler) and RKSymFoam (Backward Euler and 
Runge-Kutta 3)
* LES cases: pimpleFoam (Backward Euler) and RKSymFoam (Backward Euler and
Runge-Kutta 3)
* Run cases on a single processor from their directories using

<pre> ./launchCases.sh </pre>

* Run cases on 8 processors with the same command by first adjusting
the following lines in templateCase/run.sh to:

<pre> 
#- Run serial
# runApplication $(getApplication)

#- Run parallel 
runApplication decomposePar 
runParallel $(getApplication)
runApplication reconstructPar 
</pre>

### Post-processing

* To post-process the cases, run plot.py from the postprocessing directory
using

<pre> python plot.py </pre>

## Using RKSymFoam in your own OpenFOAM cases

* The entries in system/fvSchemes are not read by RKSymFoam, except 
potentially for the turbulence model, all other schemes can be set to:

<pre> 
    default         none;
</pre>

* In system/fvSolution, the subdictionaries for p and pFinal are named
pCorr and pCorrFinal respectively.

* A subdictionary named RungeKutta has to be added to system/fvSolution,
for example:

<pre> 
RungeKutta 
{ 
scheme          BackwardEuler; 
nOuter          1;
nInner          2; 
pnPredCoef      1; 
pRefCell        0; 
pRefValue       0; 
LES             false;
} 
</pre>

* All available schemes are based on the Butcher Tableau and can be found
in the libraries/RungeKuttaSchemes directory
* Cases are run exactly the same way as by any other OpenFOAM solver
* A transport model has to be chosen in the constant/tansportProperties 
file, similar to the usage of pimplFoam. This will be used if the LES 
variable above is set to true.
* A turbulence model has to be chosen in the constant/turbulenceProperties
file, similar to the usage of pimpleFoam. This will be used if the LES
variable above is set to true.
* If running DNS, set LES to false, as shown above. In this case the
chosen model will not be used, but need to be present as dummy variables.
* Example transport model, in constant/transportProperties add the line:

<pre>
transportModel  Newtonian;
</pre>

* Example turbulence model, create the file constant/turbulenceProperties:
<pre>
FoamFile
{
    version     2.0;
    format      ascii;
    class       dictionary;
    location    "constant";
    object      turbulenceProperties;
}

simulationType laminar;
</pre>

## Contact & support

For bug reports or support, feel free to contact Jannes Hopman at
jannes.hopman@upc.edu. Please note that this code is not maintained nor
regularly updated, and is only tested with OpenFOAM v2012. Questions
related to other versions will thus not be answered.
