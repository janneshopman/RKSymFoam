# RKSymFoam

This code contains slightly adjusted versions of the solvers used in the
paper "A symmetry-preserving second-order time-accurate PISO-based
method." by E.M.J. Komen, J.A. Hopman, E.M.A. Frederix, F.X. Trias and
R.W.C.P.  Verstappen. One notable adjustment is made in the pressure
gradient interpolation to follow the paper "An energy-preserving
unconditionally stable fractional step method on collocated grids." by D.
Santos Serrano, F.X. Trias Miquel, G. Colomer Rey and C.D. PÃ©rez Segarra.
For a description of the method, please refer to these papers. 

## Authors

The main structure of the solver, including the Runge-Kutta schemes was
developped by Edo Frederix, of the Nuclear Research and Consultancy Group
(NRG), Westerduinweg 3, 1755 LE Petten, The Netherlands. The
symmetry-preserving method was applied to this structure by Jannes Hopman,
of the Heat and Mass Transfer Technological Center, Technical University
of Catalonia, C/Colom 11, 08222 Terrassa, Spain. 

## License

RKSymFoam is published under the GNU GPL Version 3 license, which can be
found in the LICENSE file.

## Prerequisites

* OpenFOAM v2012. While it may compile against other versions, this is not
tested and currently not supported.
* Python with numpy and matplotlib

## Usage

* Make sure that OpenFOAM v2012 is loaded into your environment 
* Compile all libraries and apps with

<pre>
./Allwmake
</pre>

## Test cases

* All test cases can be found in the "cases" directory, including a
Taylor-Green Vortex and a channel flow.
* Both test cases contain a "templateCase" directory, which should be
copied before it run from inside the new directory with:

<pre>
./run.sh &ltsolver&gt &ltsimulation type&gt &ltRunge-Kutta scheme&gt
</pre> 

* Solvers permitted by this script: "icoFoam", "pimpleFoam" and
"RKSymFoam"
* Simulation types permitted by this script: "LES", "laminar" (laminar
should be selected to run DNS)
* Runge-Kutta schemes permitted by this script: "BackwardEuler", "Kutta"
(classical Runge-Kutta 3 scheme)
* icoFoam does not read the \<simulation type\> and \<Runge-Kutta scheme\>
arguments, so they can be omitted
* pimpleFoam does not read the \<Runge-Kutta scheme\> argument, so it can
be omitted
* The user is encouraged to experiment with different settings after
getting familiar with the structure of the code, to do so change the
\<VAR*\> variables inside "system/controldict.m4",
"constant/turbulenceProperties.m4" and "system/fvSolution.m4" and rename
the files to omit the ".m4" extension.
* The available Runge-Kutta schemes can be found in
"libraries/RungeKuttaSchemes/", the Butcher Tableaus are given in the
<.C> file and a reference is given in the <.H> file

### Taylor-Green Vortex

* Demonstrating the loss of kinetic energy due to numerical dissipation
over time
* Validation cases: icoFoam and RKSymFoam using Backward Euler scheme 

### Channel flow

* Demonstrating accuracy of the solver to simulate turbulence
* Demonstrating the ability to include LES models 
* Validation cases:
* DNS cases: icoFoam (Backward Euler) and RKSymFoam (Backward Euler and
Runge-Kutta 3)
* LES cases: pimpleFoam (Backward Euler) and RKSymFoam (Backward Euler and
Runge-Kutta 3)
* Run cases on 8 processors with the same command by first adjusting the
following lines in run.sh to:

<pre> 
#- Run serial
# runApplication $(getApplication)

#- Run parallel 
runApplication decomposePar 
runParallel $(getApplication)
runApplication reconstructPar 
</pre>

### Post-processing

* To post-process the cases, run "plot.py" from the 
"cases/\<case\>/postProcess" directory using

<pre>
python plot.py
</pre>

* For example: To postprocess \<run_directory\>/\<case_1_name\> and 
\<run_directory\>/\<case_2_name\>, edit the \<runDir\> and \<solvers\> 
variables in "plot.py" to:

<pre>
runDir = &ltrun_directory&gt

solvers = ['&ltcase_1_name&gt', '&ltcase_2_name&gt']
</pre>

* Resulting plots will be found in the "postProcess/results" directory

### Validation 

* A set of predetermined cases was run and post-processed by the authors.
* To run the same cases and reproduce the results, navigate to the
"cases/validation" directory and run all cases with:

<pre>
./launchCases.sh
</pre>

* After completing the cases, run "plot.py" inside 
"cases/\<case\>postProcessing", there is no need to alter "plot.py"
* The resulting plots can be compared with the results readily available
in "cases/\<case\>/postProcessing/validationResults"

## Using RKSymFoam in your own OpenFOAM cases

* The entries in system/fvSchemes are not read by RKSymFoam, except
potentially for the turbulence model, all other schemes can be set to:

<pre> 
    default         none;
</pre>

* In system/fvSolution, the subdictionaries for p and pFinal are named
pCorr and pCorrFinal respectively.
* A subdictionary named RungeKutta has to be added to system/fvSolution,
for example:

<pre> 
RungeKutta 
{ 
scheme          BackwardEuler; 
nOuter          1;
nInner          2; 
pnPredCoef      1; 
pRefCell        0; 
pRefValue       0; 
} 
</pre>

* All available schemes are based on the Butcher Tableau and can be found
in the "libraries/RungeKuttaSchemes" directory
* Cases are run exactly the same way as by any other OpenFOAM solver
* A transport model has to be chosen in "constant/tansportProperties",
similar to the usage of pimplFoam.
* A turbulence model has to be chosen in "constant/turbulenceProperties"
file, similar to the usage of pimpleFoam.
* If you want to run a DNS, set the transport model to Newtonian (1) and
the simulation type to laminar (2), as demonstrated below.
* 1\. In "constant/transportProperties" add the line:

<pre>
transportModel  Newtonian;
</pre>

* 2\. Create the file constant/turbulenceProperties:
<pre>
FoamFile
{
    version     2.0;
    format      ascii;
    class       dictionary;
    location    "constant";
    object      turbulenceProperties;
}

simulationType laminar;
</pre>
